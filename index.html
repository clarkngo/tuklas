                <h3>Tuklas - Why the Name and Logo</h3>
                <p>"Tuklas" means "discover" in Filipino, capturing the essence of a quest for new knowledge or skills. The logo draws inspiration from the Philippines' rich history and cultural heritage.</p>
                <img src="assets/magellan-discovery.png" alt="Magellan Discovery">
                <p>Our journey towards discovery resonates with the story of Magellan's expedition reaching the Philippines, symbolizing exploration and uncovering new frontiers.</p>
                <img src="assets/tinikling-dance.png" alt="Tinikling Dance">
                <p>Additionally, our logo takes inspiration from "Tinikling" — a traditional Filipino dance that requires coordination, adaptability, and rhythm.</p>
